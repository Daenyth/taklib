1. a5 a1 {Adjacent Corners opening}
2. b1 c1 {I edgecrawl, confident that the bot will play c1.}
3. b2 c5 {b2 seems the most principled follow up to b1--it extends the only
 white path both northwards and eastwards. Having seen alphatak_bot's preferred 
variation 3. ... b5, c5 was barely a surprise.}
4. b5 b3 
5. b4 d5
6. c3 1b3+1 {Taktician's response caught me somewhat offguard: I had expected a
capture from the fifth rank, but I quickly saw that Taktician's move was more 
interesting. The point is that if I mindlessly try and extend my road 2b4+ would
be unpleasant.}
7. Cc4 Cb3 {Both our caps come in, eyeing both the other's potential roads and 
the b4 square, but mine comes a tempo ahead.}
8. 1c4<1 c2 {My capture also pins black's cap.}
9. d3 e3 {We both extend our east-west threats on the side where our cap lies, i.e.
I expand in the north while Taktician expands in the south.}
10. d4 e2
11. e4 Sc4 
12. a3 d2 {In response to Taktician's c4 wall, I decide to pin the black cap two
ways with a3.}
13. a4! Sa2?! {Often, (especially when playing against bots) walls are only temporarily
defensive, and later come back to haunt you when they start hoovering up influence
in the late game. This wall, however, has no such ambitions. Once I abandon my
north-south threat (which will occur shortly) this wall becomes a huge thorn in 
black's own side. Black can scarely ever break the stronghold on a1-a2 / b1-b2; 
therefore black can never again make a serious threat on the 1st and 2nd ranks.}
14. e5 1d5-1
15. d5 1e3<1
16. 1d5-1 2d3+2 {I made a slight miscalculation that 17. e4< would be fine for me,
but here I realized that if 17. ... c4> I cannot ever crush the wall because
2b4>11 is 0-R after b3>. With that in mind, I must instead play the only 
logical move Sd3.}
17. Sd3 3d4>3? {I expected 17 ... c4>, because I didn't see any breakthroughs
for me if black surrenders c4 in exchange for d4. In fact, having the wall on
d4 seems perhaps more annoying because of the same tactic that I mentioned on
move 16.}
18. 1d3+1 4e4+4 {We dance around a bit, maneuvering control of the big 
white stack.}
19. e4 d5
20. 2d4+2 5e5-5
21. 1b4>1 1b3>1 {I decide to give up b4 and voluntarily move into a pin in hopes of
undermining black's north-south threat and eventually playing 2c4>11.}
22. b3 2b4-2 {I gladly take the space black leaves behind: b3. Note that after
2b4-2 b3 is de facto undefended, because if black ever plays 2c3< I can respond
with 2c4>11!! and black will gain a very soft stack while I gain a very hard
stack.}
23. b4 3b3+3
24. 1d4>1 1a5>1 
25. Sb3 Se3 {I get just a little bit nervous after 24. ... 1a5>1, so I
decide to play a wall on b3 instead of a flat. This was perhaps an overreaction,
but it also more firmly challenges b4, which it will eventually win, so I don't
know which move was better.}
26. 5e4<5 1e3<1?? {26. ... 1e3<1 is perhaps the losing move. If Taktician wanted
a wall on d3, why not 26 ... Sd3 and keep the e file closed? As we shall see, 
my e4 stack will be instrumental in dismantling black's threats once and for all.}
27. d1 1d3+1
28. 1d1<1 d1
29. 1b2>1 2c3-2 
30. e1 3c2-3 {With e1 I lay my penultimate flat and gain the power to end the game
whenever I wish. Black must now play with only the flat count in mind.}
31. 2e4-11! 4c1<4 {Black's response is forced.}
32. 1b3+1 1d2>1
33. 4b4-13 2e2+2
34. 1b4+1 1c5<1 {My cap is finally unpinned.}
35. 1c4>1 c3
36. 5d4<14 1c3+1
37. 1d4<1 d2 {As I will win next move on flats, Taktician doesn't bother blocking
the road threat.}
38. e4 {R-0} R-0
